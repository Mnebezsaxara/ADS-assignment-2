/**
 * This project implements several data structures including ArrayList, LinkedList, Stack, Queue, and MinHeap.
 * These data structures are implemented using generic types to provide flexibility in the type of elements they can hold.
 * 
 * The MyArrayList class implements a dynamic array, allowing for efficient random access to elements and dynamic resizing as needed.
 * 
 * The MyLinkedList class implements a doubly linked list, offering efficient insertion and deletion operations at both ends of the list.
 * 
 * The MyStack class is implemented using a LinkedList as the underlying data structure. It follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle,
 * where elements are added and removed from the same end of the stack.
 * 
 * The MyQueue class is also implemented using a LinkedList. It follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, where elements are added
 * at the end of the queue and removed from the front.
 * 
 * The MyMinHeap class is implemented using an ArrayList. It represents a binary min-heap, where the minimum element is always at the root.
 * It supports operations like insertion, extraction of the minimum element, and heapifying to maintain the heap property.
 * 
 * Each data structure provides various methods for manipulation and access, including adding, removing, accessing elements, and checking
 * the size and emptiness of the structure.
